# Needle Drop Roulette Host Instructions

## Round loop (recommended)
1. `Advance Drop` to move to next prepared call.
2. Play 5-10 seconds and collect slips/board answers.
3. `Lock Answers` before discussing guesses.
4. `Reveal` answer.
5. Score each team:
- Artist + Title = 2
- Artist only or Title only = 1
- Miss = 0
6. `Save Scores for Current Drop`.
7. Repeat until all rounds complete.

## Fast solo-host practices
- Keep one tie-break drop staged before session start.
- Use the same answer mode all session (`slips`, `whiteboard`, or `mixed`).
- If floor traffic spikes, hit `Pause`, recover flow, then `Resume`.
- Keep score overrides minimal and use notes for any dispute rulings.

## Error recovery
- If a drop is unusable, mark `Skip` and advance.
- If scores were entered incorrectly, re-save scores for the same call (upsert behavior updates existing rows).
- If a session reaches final call, next advance auto-completes the session.
