# Original or Cover Host Runbook

## Round flow (solo-host)
1. `Advance Call` when next record is cued.
2. Announce: teams must call `original` or `cover`, then optionally name original artist.
3. Keep guess window tight (target gap timer is your floor pacing guide).
4. `Reveal` once all tables are locked.
5. Score each team:
- Correct side call: `+2` (default)
- Correct original artist bonus: `+1` (default)
6. Save scores and move to next call.

## Control usage guide
- `Advance Call`: activates next pending row and starts running state.
- `Mark Asked`: manual fallback if host advanced externally.
- `Reveal`: shows correct side + original artist in host/jumbotron.
- `Skip`: marks row skipped for dead needle/missing media moments.
- `Pause/Resume`: freeze/restart pacing timer when floor interruptions occur.

## Scoring guidance
- If no side call is submitted: leave as `No call`.
- Bonus should only be awarded when side call is correct and original artist name matches accepted key.
- Use manual points override only for special rulings (write brief note if needed).

## Vinyl pacing safeguards
- Keep two backup quick-swap pairs staged at all times.
- Prefer crate order that minimizes walking/cross-cueing between rounds.
- If a record is damaged, `Skip` quickly and keep room momentum.
- Use assistant for score verification only; do not split transport control.

## Tie-break method
1. Keep one reserve pair out of normal round count.
2. Announce tie-break criteria before spin.
3. Run same scoring logic as normal rounds.
4. Save tie-break scores before announcing winner.
